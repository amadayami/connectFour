# connectFour

I wrote this connectFour program for an Intermediate Programming assignment. The GUI code was provided to us by the professor.

## How to play
Click on the column where you wish to place your piece. The computer player will also choose a position.
Play continues until one player gets four in a row. Basic Connect Four rules.
